 Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python

# Why Learn Spark?
Spark is currently one of the most popular tools for big data analytics. You might have heard of other tools such as Hadoop. Hadoop is a slightly older technology although still in use by some companies. Spark is generally faster than Hadoop, which is why Spark has become more popular over the last few years.

There are many other big data tools and systems, each with its own use case. For example, there are database system like Apache Cassandra and SQL query engines like Presto. But Spark is still one of the most popular tools for analyzing large data sets.

# Hadoop Vocabulary
Here is a list of some terms associated with Hadoop. Terms and how they relate to Spark.

* <b>Hadoop</b> - an ecosystem of tools for big data storage and data analysis. Hadoop is an older system than Spark but is still used by many companies. The major difference between Spark and Hadoop is how they use memory. Hadoop writes intermediate results to disk whereas Spark tries to keep data in memory whenever possible. This makes Spark faster for many use cases.

* <b>Hadoop MapReduce</b> - a system for processing and analyzing large data sets in parallel.

* <b>Hadoop YARN</b> - a resource manager that schedules jobs across a cluster. The manager keeps track of what computer resources are available and then assigns those resources to specific tasks.

* <b>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</b> - a big data storage system that splits data into chunks and stores the chunks across a cluster of computers

As Hadoop matured, other tools were developed to make Hadoop easier to work with. These tools included:

* <b>Apache Pig</b> - a SQL-like language that runs on top of Hadoop MapReduce
* <b>Apache Hive</b> - another SQL-like interface that runs on top of Hadoop MapReduce
Oftentimes when someone is talking about Hadoop in general terms, they are actually talking about Hadoop MapReduce. However, Hadoop is more than just MapReduce. In the next part of the lesson, you'll learn more about how MapReduce works.

# How is Spark related to Hadoop?
Spark, which is the main, is another big data framework. Spark contains libraries for data analysis, machine learning, graph analysis, and streaming live data. Spark is generally faster than Hadoop. This is because Hadoop writes intermediate results to disk whereas Spark tries to keep intermediate results in memory whenever possible.

The Hadoop ecosystem includes a distributed file storage system called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). Spark, on the other hand, does not include a file storage system. You can use Spark on top of HDFS but you do not have to. Spark can read in data from other sources as well such as Amazon S3.

# Streaming Data
Data streaming is a specialized topic in big data. The use case is when you want to store and analyze data in real-time such as Facebook posts or Twitter tweets.

Spark has a streaming library called [Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html) although it is not as popular and fast as some other streaming libraries. Other popular streaming libraries include [Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) and [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/).

# Map Reduce
MapReduce is a programming technique for manipulating large data sets. "Hadoop MapReduce" is a specific implementation of this programming technique.

The technique works by first dividing up a large dataset and distributing the data across a cluster. In the map step, each data is analyzed and converted into a (key, value) pair. Then these key-value pairs are shuffled across the cluster so that all keys are on the same machine. In the reduce step, the values with the same keys are combined together.

While Spark doesn't implement MapReduce, you can write Spark programs that behave in a similar way to the map-reduce paradigm

**In the map-reduce paradigm, what happens in the shuffle step?**<br/>
Data points with the same key get moved to the same cluster node

# Spark Use Cases and Resources

Here are a few resources about different Spark use cases:
* Data Analytics
* Machine Learning
* Streaming
* Graph Analytics

# Spark's Limitations
Spark has some limitation.

Spark Streamingâ€™s latency is at least 500 milliseconds since it operates on micro-batches of records, instead of processing one record at a time. Native streaming tools such as Storm, Apex, or Flink can push down this latency value and might be more suitable for low-latency applications. Flink and Apex can be used for batch computation as well, so if you're already using them for stream processing, there's no need to add Spark to your stack of technologies.

Another limitation of Spark is its selection of machine learning algorithms. Currently, Spark only supports algorithms that scale linearly with the input data size. In general, deep learning is not available either, though there are many projects integrate Spark with Tensorflow and other deep learning tools.

# Hadoop versus Spark
The Hadoop ecosystem is a slightly older technology than the Spark ecosystem. In general, Hadoop MapReduce is slower than Spark because Hadoop writes data out to disk during intermediate steps. However, many big companies, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, started using Big Data early and built their infrastructure around the Hadoop ecosystem.

While Spark is great for iterative algorithms, there is not much of a performance boost over Hadoop MapReduce when doing simple counting. Migrating legacy code to Spark, especially on hundreds of nodes that are already in production, might not be worth the cost for the small performance boost.

# Beyond Spark for Storing and Processing Big Data
Keep in mind that Spark is not a data storage system, and there are a number of tools besides Spark that can be used to process and analyze large datasets.

Sometimes it makes sense to use the power and simplicity of SQL on big data. For these cases, a new class of databases, know as NoSQL and NewSQL, have been developed.

For example, you might hear about newer database storage systems like HBase or Cassandra. There are also distributed SQL engines like Impala and Presto. Many of these technologies use query syntax that you are likely already familiar with based on your experiences with Python and SQL.

In the lessons ahead, you will learn about Spark specifically, but know that many of the skills you already have with SQL, Python, and soon enough, Spark, will also be useful if you end up needing to learn any of these additional Big Data tools.
